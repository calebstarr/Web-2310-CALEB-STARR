        Batman: The Animated Series, which first aired in 1992, is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated superhero shows ever created. Developed by Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski, the series redefined Batman for a new generation with its dark, art deco–inspired “Dark Deco” aesthetic, mature storytelling, and rich emotional depth. Kevin Conroy’s commanding performance as Batman, paired with Mark Hamill’s unforgettable portrayal of the Joker, set a new standard for voice acting in animation. The show balanced action and psychological drama, exploring not just Batman’s crusade against crime but the tragic humanity of his villains. Its success influenced nearly every Batman adaptation that followed and laid the groundwork for the entire DC Animated Universe.
